Streamify Music Streaming Service/Database

# Overview
Streamify, aims to provide a streamlined database-driven platform that allows administrators to manage essential components of a music streaming service.
Streamify would serve as an internal tool for managing artists, albums, songs, and user-generated playlists, ensuring that music libraries are organized efficiently. The system will allow administrators to:
- Add and manage new songs, albums, and artists.
- Monitor the total number of streams for each artist and track.
- Organize songs into user-created playlists.
- Allow users to create profiles and subscribe to different subscription tiers.
- Allow users to keep track of songs that they like

The platform will manage millions of tracks from thousands of artists as well as keep track of the streaming history of millions of users, making it a perfect solution for music distribution. With this reliable back-end database, Streamify will ensure accurate tracking of streams, easy management of content, and efficient generation of user playlists to offer a premium experience for both administrators and users.
Streamifyâ€™s subscription service currently generates $10 million per year from our multi-tiered subscription service that allows users to pick a plan affordable to them.  Streamify requires users to create an account which defines their subscription type to be recorded in our Users table.
